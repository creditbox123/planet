# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Web App on every push to the master branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE with the value of your Node publish profile.
#
# 2. Change the values for the NODE_WEBAPP_NAME, NODE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables  (below).
